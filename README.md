# Bakery Treats

#### By Kirsten Opstad

#### A web app to market sweet and savory treats for a fictional bakery

## Technologies Used

* C#
* .Net 6
* ASP.Net Core 6 MVC
* EF Core 6
* SQL
* MySQL
* LINQ
* Identity

## Description

A student project demonstrating knowledge about user authentication and many-to-many relationships.

### Objectives (MVP)

#### Required Features
* The application should have user authentication. A user should be able to log in and log out. Only logged in users should have create, update, and delete functionality. All users should be able to have read functionality.
* There should be a many-to-many relationship between Treats and Flavors. A treat can have many flavors (such as sweet, savory, spicy, or creamy) and a flavor can have many treats. For instance, the "sweet" flavor could include chocolate croissants, cheesecake, and so on.
* A user should be able to navigate to a splash page that lists all treats and flavors. Users should be able to click on an individual treat or flavor to see all the treats/flavors that belong to it.

Additionally, code will be reviewed on the following: 
* Does at least one of your classes have all CRUD methods implemented in your app?
* Are you able to view both sides of the many-many relationship? For a particular instance of a class, are you able to view all of the instances of the other class that are related to it?
* Are users able to register, log in and log out with Identity?
* Is Create, Update and Delete functionality limited to authenticated users?
* Build files and sensitive information are included in .gitignore file and are not in Git history, and includes instructions on how to create the appsettings.json and set up the project.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* The promptâ€™s required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place by the deadline.

### Goals
1. Meet MVP
2. Add basic styling
3. Stretch: Have separate roles for admins and logged-in users. Only admins should be able to add, update and delete.
4. Stretch: Add an order form that only logged-in users can access. A logged-in user should be able to create, read, update and delete their own order.
6. Strech: Add functionality of Bakery

  }
}
```
3. Install dependencies within the `Project Name` directory
```
$ dotnet restore
````

4. To build & run program in development mode 
 ```
 $ dotnet run
 ```

5. To build & run program in production mode 
 ```
 dotnet run --launch-profile "production"
 ```
